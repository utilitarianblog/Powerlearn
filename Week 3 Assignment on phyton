# Question
Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.
Using the calculate_discount function, prompt the user to enter the original price of an item and the discount percentage. Print the final price after applying the discount, or if no discount was applied, print the original price.

# solution 
def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    """
    Calculates the final price after applying a discount.
    Applies the discount only if it is 20% or higher.
    """
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        discount_amount = (discount_percent / 100) * price
        return price - discount_amount
    else:
        return price

# Prompt the user for input
original_price = float(input("Enter the original price of the item: "))
discount_percent = float(input("Enter the discount percentage: "))

# Calculate and display the final price
final_price = calculate_discount(original_price, discount_percent)
print(f"Final price after applying discount: {final_price:.2f}")
